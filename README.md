## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This challenge helped me build onto my CSS abilities. One thing I had trouble with was centering the card. Eventually after various google searches I was able to center the body and card using

```css
  .body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  }
```
